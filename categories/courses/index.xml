      <description>An example of the code that is built through the workshops can be found on my GitHub.More detailed notes as well as executed code can be found in my notes. The goal of these short workshops is to give graduate students a very prelimenary introduction into coding in R. While having an instructor teach you these things may be helpful, in my belief, coding, like math, you have to learn by doing.</description>
