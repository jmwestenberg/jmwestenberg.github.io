      <description>This post assumes a basic knowledge of R.
Using leaflet we can map shapefiles and specific points. As an illustrative example I will be using code I wrote earlier this year when I was looking into some questions regarding schools and state government. The shapefiles I will be using are the lower and upper legislatures for the state of Wisconsin. The points I will be mapping in the second post of this series will be specific school locations.</description>

      <description>Steak and PotatoesStrip Steak seasoned with a balsamic vinegar rub and montreal steak seasoning. Fried potatoes and onions in a cast iron pan directly on the grill.
Veggie AssortmentThis was my first time grilling veggies like this and they turned out stellar! A bit of olive oil, salt and pepper before tossing on the grill. Then made a balsamic vinegar drizzle for them: olive oil, balsamic vinegar, fresh rosemary, parsley, and sage.</description>
