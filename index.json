If you find errors, please let me know by emailing jwesten@iu.edu\nAn example of my code for this course is avaialabe on my github repository at https://github.com/jmwestenberg/Rcourse.\nThe goal of these short courses are to give graduate students a very prelimenary introduction into coding in R. While having an ‘instructor’ teach you these things may be helpful, in my belief, coding, like math, you have to learn by doing. So I highly encourage following these notes, but then play around with the code. Change things and see how it changes the output. I think this is the best way to learn.\nOver the next 3 ‘sessions’ we will be looking into county level unemployment data. The goal will be to provide examples and descriptions of the commands and techniques I have discovered to be most useful while working with data. Specifically the goal is by the end of the 3 sessions you will know how to:\n\rdownload data straight into R\rread in data (Rda, csv, xlsx, dta)\rmerge datasets\rsubset datasets\rcreate summary statistics and plots\rrun basic regressions\r\rall while paying particular attention to file pathing and to teach you how to export graphics and tables from R into a form that can be directly into LaTex (so that it can be easily read into paper/presentation documents).\nBelow is an example of an interactive plot you can make with a package called plotly. Try interacting with it! In the plot you can select/deselect states you want to view. There is also a link to a short post I made about using GIS with R. I show these to illustrate a bit of what is possible to do in R after we familiarize ourselves with the basic functions.\n\r{\"x\":{\"visdat\":{\"37f8243c5e07\":[\"function ()

Then, we will investigate the work-horse models of trade in economics: the Ricardian model, the Heckscher-Ohlin model, and the New Trade theories. These models formalize our intuition about why countries might trade with each other and how trade might affect each country and the individuals residing in each.\nWe will then spend some time examining the effects of trade policy using the ubiquitous supply-and-demand model, keeping the basic ideas of the previously covered trade models in mind. This includes tariffs, quotas, export subsidies, voluntary export restraints, and a discussion of non-tariff barriers to trade that often come through customs policies or cultural arguments.\nLastly, we will touch on the macro side of international economics. After introducing important definitions, including the current account, capital account, and financial account, we will spend some time discussing exchange rates and their determination.\nCourse Learning Objectives: At the end of the course, students should be able to:\n colloquially describe the gains from trade defend the idea of gains from trade from common criticisms explain how trade can harm some groups within a country explain how tax policy can be used to mitigate harm to those groups harmed by trade describe the costs associated with various trade policies, such as tariffs explain the role of international trade organizations and agreements in trade explain the link between the trade balance and investment flows use purchasing power parity and interest parity conditions to assess currency values  Course Organization Students are expected to come to class prepared. This entails reading any assigned material and completing assigned problems before class. Problems will be collected at the beginning of class before instruction begins. Lectures will compliment and facilitate understanding of the read material. Reading is not a substitute for attending class, nor is coming to class a perfect substitute for reading the material. Assignments and readings will be announced in class and posted on canvas.\nCourse Expectations and Workload My expectations for you in this class are simple, respect your fellow classemates’ learning environments.That is any behavior that disrupts the learning environment is unacceptable.\nYou can expect me to come to class each week prepared. I will work my best to help you understand the material. I will be fair and consistent in the grading of all assessments. My goal is to help every one of you understand economics better.\nWhat I expect of you is to work hard to understand all material. If you do not understand the material after studying it, I have an expectation that you will either ask one of your classmates or myself for help. Your classmates can be a valuable resource to you. This is a 3 credit course, so my expectation is standard that you spend 6 hours outside of class studying the material.\nExams Exams will be either multiple choice, graphical/numerical problems, short essay questions, or a combination of the three. There will be two in-class exams each worth 15% or 75 points of your grade. Those will take place during regular class time on Tuesday, February 11th and Tuesday, March 31st. The final exam is worth 25% or 125 points of your grade and will take place on Tuesday, May 5th from 5:00-7:00PM. If you think that any of your exam questions have been incorrectly graded then you must contact your instructor within 7 days of receiving your exam grade.\nHomeworks There will be 6 homework assignments through the course of the semester. They will consist of multiple choice, short answer, and data related questions. All together the homework will be worth 10% of 50 points of your final grade. The lowest score will be dropped. These will be announced in class and posted on canvas.\nReading Assignments There will be 6 reading assignments, consisting of reading one or two articles from a major news outlet and reflecting on the issues raised about international economics. They are worth 10% or 50 points of your grade. The lowest score will be dropped. All reading assignments will be available on Canvas along with instructions.\nGroup Project There will be a course project, broken into 3-4 parts. Details will be released in upcoming weeks. The project will be worth 15% or 75 points of your grade.\nAttendance and Participation Throughout the semester there will be opportunities to engage with the material during lecture time. Papers from these opportunities will often be collected and used as attendance. There will also be discussions during the class that will give opportunities to participate. Attendance and participation is worth 10% or 50 points of your final grade.\nGrades     Points Percentage     Exam I 75 15%   Exam II 75 15%   Final Exam 125 25%   Homeworks 50 10%   Readings 50 10%   Project 75 15%   Attendance/Participation 50 10%   Total: 500 100%       Grade Percentage     A+ 100-97   A 96-92   A- 91-88   B+ 87-85   B 84-81   B- 80-77   C+ 76-74   C 73-70   C- 69-67   D+ 66-64   D 63-60   D- 59-55   F Below 55    Make up policy Built into the course is an extra reading assignment and an extra homework. These are built in knowing that things arise over the course of the semester. There will also be an exam make-up time for excused absences. These absences must be approved by me 48-hours before the exam time begins. Emergencies will be handled on a case by case basis. Illness or injury, family emergencies, certain University-approved curricular and extra-curricular activities, and religious holidays can be legitimate reasons to miss class or to be excused from a scheduled examination.\nWith regard to family emergencies, you must provide verifiable documentation of the emergency. Given the vast array of family emergencies the instructor will provide precise guidance as to what constitutes adequate documentation. Unless the emergency is critical you should notify the instructor in advance of your absence from the scheduled course event. In cases of critical emergencies, you must notify the instructor within one week of your absence.\nFor University-approved curricular and extra-curricular activities, verifiable documentation is also required. The student should obtain from the unit or department sponsoring the activity a letter (or class absence form) indicating the anticipated absence(s). The letter must be presented to the instructor at least one week prior to the first absence.\nIn the case of religious holidays, the student should notify the instructor by the third week of the course of any potential conflicts.\nAcademic Integrity As a student at IU, you are expected to adhere to the standards and policies detailed in the Code of Student Rights, Responsibilities, and Conduct. When you submit an assignment with your name on it, you are signifying that the work contained therein is yours, unless otherwise cited or referenced. Any ideas or materials taken from another source for either written or oral use must be fully acknowledged. All suspected violations of the Code will be reported to the Dean of Students and handled according to University policies. Sanctions for academic misconduct may include a failing grade on the assignment, reduction in your final course grade, and a failing grade in the course, among other possibilities. If you are unsure about the expectations for completing an assignment or taking a test or exam, be sure to seek clarification beforehand.\nAutomatic Withdrawal The last day to withdraw from the course and receive an automaticWis Sunday, March 15. After this date, withdrawals will only be granted in accordance with University policy. After automatic withdrawal period, withdrawals are only allowed with permission of their dean. These approvals are typically only given for reasons that make it “extremely difficult to drop a class by the Auto-W Deadline or that impede success in a class after the Auto-W deadline.” To qualify for a grade of W after the deadline, a student must be passing the class on the date of withdrawal, if failing, the grade will be an F. More information can be found on the academic advising website.\nAccommodations If you need classroom or testing accommodations for a disability, please contact me outside of class to present the written supporting memorandum of accommodation from the Office of Disability Services for Students. Requests for accommodations for disability must be received and authorized by me in written form no less than two weeks in advance of need, in order to allow adequate time to review and make appropriate arrangements. No accommodation should be assumed until authorized by your instructor.\nImportant Miscellaneous  The best way to reach me is via email or office hours. I have found office hours are typically much more efficient for resolving multiple, or longer questions. I will typically respond to emails within 24 hours of regular business hours. If you have a conflict with my regular office hours and wish to attend, send me an email and we can most likely find another time to meet. Modification of policies may be required during the semester. The instructor will make explicit announcements pertaining to any such changes.

There are plenty of guides online on how to do this.\nLet’s first define some arrays within R.\nThese can be numeric based, in this case integer.\nA\u0026lt;-c(5,6,7) # 1\rB\u0026lt;-c(7,8,9) # 2\rLet’s dig into what is going on a bit more. We are telling R to define a vector, this is the c( ) part, with elements 1,2,3 and give that vector a name A. The backwards arrow tells R what is the name and what is the element we are defining.\nWe can make character based vectors as well.\nC\u0026lt;-c(\u0026quot;a\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;b\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;c\u0026quot;) # 1\rD\u0026lt;-c(\u0026quot;d\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;e\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;f\u0026quot;) # 2\rWe can then combine these vectors into a dataframe (this is relevant for when we start thinking about reading in/manipulating actual data). Since all of our vectors are length three, we can easily create a dataframe (think a matrix) where our column names will be the name of the vectors, and the rows will be the elements of the vectors.\nfirst_dataframe\u0026lt;-data.frame(A,B,C,D) # 1\rprint(first_dataframe) # 2\r## A B C D\r## 1 5 7 a d\r## 2 6 8 b e\r## 3 7 9 c f\rNow first_dataframe is going to be of similar format as we will typically have when we read in data from excel files into R. We can access certain rows and columns within the dataframe by putting square brackets after the name of the dataframe. For example if we wanted to print the element in the first row and first column, we could define the variable x as this and then print x. (Keep in mind the ordering is rows, columns)\nx\u0026lt;-first_dataframe[1,1] # 1\rprint(x) # 2\r## [1] 5\rWhat if we wanted to print all elements in the first row, we just leave the column (after the comma) blank:\nx\u0026lt;-first_dataframe[1,] # 1\rprint(x) # 2\r## A B C D\r## 1 5 7 a d\rHow about 1st \u0026amp; 3rd row?\nx\u0026lt;-first_dataframe[c(1,3),] # 1\rprint(x) # 2\r## A B C D\r## 1 5 7 a d\r## 3 7 9 c f\rAnother way to do this is to define another variable, say y as a vector with elements 1 and 3. Notice how the below output is the same as the above.\ny\u0026lt;-c(1,3) # 1\rx\u0026lt;-first_dataframe[y,] # 2\rprint(x) # 3\r## A B C D\r## 1 5 7 a d\r## 3 7 9 c f\rWe can do the same thing for the columns (we need to remember the order for the square brackets are rows, columns). Note: if we put a negative sign in front of these commands in the brackets, instead “keeping” certain rows or columns, it means remove! That is if in the below command we have -3, it would be saying REMOVE column 3!\nx\u0026lt;-first_dataframe[,3] # 1\ry\u0026lt;-first_dataframe[,-3] # 2\rprint(x) # 3\r## [1] a b c\r## Levels: a b c\rprint(y) # 1\r## A B D\r## 1 5 7 d\r## 2 6 8 e\r## 3 7 9 f\rOur third column is named C, we can also pull this column by referencing it’s name after a dollar sign, such as:\nx\u0026lt;-first_dataframe$C # 1\rprint(x) # 2\r## [1] a b c\r## Levels: a b c\rThis may not sound useful now, but think if we have many columns of variables, say wage, hoursworked, fulltime, and hundreds of more. We don’t want to have to find what column number hoursworked is, we can just reference this column name.\n“And” and “Or” Operators\rA couple common operators that we may want to use are “and” and “or” statements.

It allows us to make many different kinds of plots and customize them. As it is so popular there are many guides for it. Tidyverse’s website summarizes some very useful resources.\nAs ggplot2 has so many options, we will just be barely skimming the surface in this introduction. Let’s start with a minimal command.

This is where we tell ggplot how to map our data into the plots.

Let’s just suppress it for now. To do this we can define the legend.position in theme as none. The theme command allows for a lot of customization with the plot. If you want to see all options click here. Let’s also change the thickness of the lines, we can do this with the alpha argument.\nggplot(data=indiana, aes(x=Year, y=Unemp_rate, # 1\rcolour=County_fips, group=County_fips))+ # 2\rgeom_line(size=0.3)+ # 3\rtheme(legend.position=\u0026quot;none\u0026quot;) # 4\rThis already is looking a lot better.

Let’s start with the second line. The operator %\u0026gt;% is called a pipe. This comes from a package called magittr which is included within tidyverse.

Here we are using a filter command, so we are saying take our data.frame county_data, then filter or “give us” the values where State_fips is equal to “18” (this is fips code for Indiana. Go Hoosiers!). So in summary we are just filtering out indiana data and saving it as a new data frame (this is line 1).

We could break our vector into single character digits and two character digits, manipulate the single character digits, then combine it back in with the double character digits.

But what is str_pad doing? With str_pad we are telling stringr we want all elements of numbvec to be of length 2. So stringr checks to see if the elements are less than 2 characters, if an element is it adds “0”’s to the left side until it reaches length 2. If it is already length 2, it will leave it alone.\nThere is many other handy commands to deal with strings in R. These are just a couple of commands we will be using. I will be writing a post with some other handy functions in the coming weeks and will link it here.\n\r","date":1612483200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1612483200,"objectID":"f6729b7fe4e233d2963aff55a520213a","permalink":"/courses/rcourse/lesson1/lesson1_03/","publishdate":"2021-02-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/courses/rcourse/lesson1/lesson1_03/","section":"courses","summary":"String Concatenation\ra\u0026lt;-\u0026quot;This is a the start\u0026quot; # 1\rb\u0026lt;-\u0026quot;of a sentence\u0026quot; # 2\rprint(paste0(a,b)) # 3\r## [1] \u0026quot;This is a the startof a sentence\u0026quot;\rprint(paste(a,b)) # 1\r## [1] \u0026quot;This is a the start of a sentence\u0026quot;\rNotice we define a and b as strings.","tags":null,"title":"String Manipulation","type":"book"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"\rDownloading within R\rWe can use R to with a direct link to download. The first argument the download.file() command takes that we will use is the url of the xslx document and the second argument is the destination it will be saved.

Opening up the file in excel we can see there will be issues reading the file in.\rWe can notice that the first row has the file title spread across columns A:J. Variable names are spread across anywhere 1-3 rows. And lastly we have an empty column in F. The bright side is if we observe the other year’s files, they all have this exact same structure. Hence we will able to use a loop eventually to clean them all instead of one at a time.\nThe main package we will be using is readxl, which is quite self explanatory. It is a package meant to help to read in excel docs. Let’s try to open the file for 1990 we downloaded in R. We can do this through R Studio’s functionality.\nWithin the “Environment” area of R Studio, click Import Dataset, then From Excel…\rThere is definitely multiple ways to do this, as we can see from the options available. I first deselect “First Row as Names” (This option is very nice if your data is already in a precleaned form and your first row simply has your variable names.) I then begin to skip rows, 5 rows of skipping leads to the first row being the first row of data.\nNext we can handle column F that we noticed was blank. This is column 6 and stays consistent across all years (you can check this). Remembering our lessons from the Very Basics section we can subset this dataframe by removing column 6.\nHence we have something that will look like the following for our command for our script.\nrequire(readxl) # 1\rworkingdir\u0026lt;-\u0026quot;C:/Users/weste/Documents/GitHub/Rcourse\u0026quot; # 2\rbls_unemp_90 \u0026lt;- read_excel(paste0(workingdir, \u0026quot;/raw_data/bls_unemp_90.xlsx\u0026quot;), col_names=FALSE, skip=5) # 3\rbls_unemp_90\u0026lt;-bls_unemp_90[,-6] # 4\rcol_names(bls_unemp_90)\u0026lt;-c(\u0026quot;LAUS_code\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;State_fips\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;County_fips\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;County_name\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Year\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Labor_force\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Employed\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Unemployed\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Unemp_rate\u0026quot;) # 5\rWhere the last line above we are giving our columns names based on the names we saw in the excel document.\nWe can then observe our data frame to ssee if it’s fully cleaned. At first it seems so (I actually initially thought so). However when reading in the data, we grabbed 2 extra rows at the end of the file. Hence we have 2 rows at the end of our data frame that are NA’s. Let’s drop these two rows, to do this we can use a command is.na and prior to it include an “!”, saying ‘not is.na’.\nbls_unemp_90\u0026lt;-bls_unemp_90[!is.na(bls_unemp_90$State_fips),] # 1\r\rDownloading/Reading Data in a Loop\rHere is a good place to pause if you want a challenge.

But we don’t want a leading 0 in front of the double ‘character’ digits (ie We DON’T want “090”). Go back to the String Manipulation section if you need to refresh on this.\rLine #6 : Calculate the length of years and save as years_l\rLine #7 : See String Manipulation if defining the for loop does not make sense.\rLine #8 : We are creating the character string for the url for the download link.

Then do this for all iterations of our FIPStxt ID.\nThere are join commands for this in the dplyr package. The clearest join command is full_join. This matches data frames based on common variable names (or defined variable names to match on.)

To start the map generation, lets limit users to only be able to zoom out so far.\rThis provides a base map where we will lay our other shapes on top of. We can label this so we can refer to\rit later (in line 12).\rThis sets the initial view, centered on a latitude and longitude point with a certain initial zoom\rTo restrict the user from venturing too far from your area of interest you can restrict the frame of the map.\rTo see this, try to pull the map in any direction, you can’t get too far until it bounces you back to a relevant frame.\rHere is where we layer our district shapefile on top of that base map we established in line 6.\rLeaflet recognizes the Spatial Polygon Dataframe as such and knows how to handle it. The color option sets the\rcolor of the border of the districts and the weight is how thick these borders are.\rContinuing with the district shapefile options. To fill the shapes with different colors,\rwe use the colors we generated in lines 2-4. The fillOpacity command allows you to adjust\rhow much you can see through the shape. Notice how you can still make out information on\rthe base map? That’s because we set this option to less than 1. The popup option is telling\rleaflet we want to see districtinfo for the area we are clicking on in the map.\rWe can label this layer as “Lower”, this allows us to refer to it in the layers control below.\rLastly, this layer control allows us to tell leaflet that we want the “base” to always be\rvisible on the map, but we can add/remove “Lower”. To see this in the map below click the icon\rin the upper right corner. Notice how we can uncheck and recheck “Lower”?

These two realities may lead employers to offer, and caregivers to accept, lower paying jobs that come with more time flexibility. Since caregivers in the United States are disproportionally women, this may help to explain the lingering gender wage gap in the U.S. Data sets were combined from the 2015 revision of the Occupational Information Network (O*NET) and the 2003 through 2015 March Current Population Surveys to analyze this issue.
