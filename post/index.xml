&lt;p&gt;I started the journey with creating a website this past winter. With the stay-at-home orders and being back in Wisconsin, where its still rarely above 45 degrees, I decided to actually put the finishing touches
on it and experimenting with how to publish it online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I knew about and had been using Hugo Academic since the winter to slowly create content, I just recently learned that with github, you can host your own website for free! Being an economist though, I have to
note that the website isnâ€™t actually free, I put many hours into debugging, but now I am finally at a point to make it public!&lt;/p&gt;
