      <description>An example of the code that is built through the workshops can be found on my GitHub.   More detailed notes as well as executed code can be found in my notes.    The goal of these short workshops is to give graduate students a very prelimenary introduction into coding in R. While having an instructor teach you these things may be helpful, in my belief, coding, like math, you have to learn by doing.</description>

      <description>This post assumes a basic knowledge of R.
Using leaflet we can map shapefiles and specific points. As an illustrative example I will be using code I wrote earlier this year when I was looking into some questions regarding schools and state government. The shapefiles I will be using are the lower and upper legislatures for the state of Wisconsin. The points I will be mapping in the second post of this series will be specific school locations.</description>

      <description>Steak and Potatoes     Strip Steak seasoned with a balsamic vinegar rub and montreal steak seasoning. Fried potatoes and onions in a cast iron pan directly on the grill.
Veggie Assortment     This was my first time grilling veggies like this and they turned out stellar! A bit of olive oil, salt and pepper before tossing on the grill. Then made a balsamic vinegar drizzle for them: olive oil, balsamic vinegar, fresh rosemary, parsley, and sage.</description>
