- What would happen to the amount you buy?

- By how much?
  - What does this depend on?

## In General:

.large[
The quantity demanded change in response to a price change depends on:

- the amount of the price change
- how responsive you are to a change in price

]

## Price Responsiveness

.large[
Consider two different consumers with different demands for coffee:

- Amber
- Amy

.large[
Consider two different consumers with different demands for coffee:

- Amy

Price changes from $2.50 to $5

## Elasticity

.large[
We can quantify this change in quantity demanded by using **elasticity.**

## Elasticity

.large[
We can quantify this change in quantity demanded by using **elasticity.**

**Elasticity** is the percentage change in one variable in response to the percentage change in another.

## Price Elasticity of Demand

.large[

`$$\frac{\% \text{ Change in Quantity Demanded}}{\% \text{ Change in Price}}$$`

That is to what extend did Amber and Amy's quantity demanded change with the price change

Recall Law of Demand (Increase in price leads to decrease in quantity)
- What does this imply for sign of Price Elasticity of Demand

## Practice Problems

.large[
1. If the price changes by 10% and the elasticity is 0.7, then by how much would quantity demanded change?
2. If the price changes by 10% and the quantity demanded changes by 3%, then what is the elasticity of demand.
3. If we know that the elasticity of demand is 0.5 and we see that that quantity demanded has changed by 15%, then we can infer that the price has changed by how much?]

## Answers
.large[
1. quantity demanded changes by 7%
2. elasticity of demand is -0.3 (Note oftentimes given as absolute value)
3. the price has changed by 30%

## Firm Side:

.large[
When a price is set/changed, elasticity has important implications for total revenue.

`$$\text{TR(P)} = P \times Q(P)$$`
Why do we have "(P)"?]

## Firm Side:

.large[
When a price is set/changed, elasticity has important implications for total revenue.

`$$\text{TR(P)} = P \times Q(P)$$`
Why do we have "(P)"?
- Want to express the quantity depends on price! (Law of Demand)

If the % change in Price is greater than the % change in quantity demanded, TR goes up!

`$$\text{TR(P)} = P \times Q(P)$$`
Why do we have "(P)"?
- Want to express the quantity depends on price! (Law of Demand)

If the % change in Price is greater than the % change in quantity demanded, TR goes up!
- How does this relate to elasticity?
]

## Practice

.large[
For each case below. What is the elasticity? Does total revenue decrease or increase?

1. Price increases by 20%, quantity demanded falls by 10%.
2. Price increases by 20%, quantity demanded falls by 20%.
3. Price increases by 20%, quantity demanded falls by 30%.

## Substitution and Cross-Price Elasticity

.large[
Substitution and elasticity are related.

For substitutes, we can calculate how a change in price of one good influences the quantity demanded of the other.

- If price of hazelnut creamer goes up, the demand for french vanilla creamer would increase.
- If price of Columbian coffee rises, demand for Peruvian coffee rises

]

---

## Cross-Price Elasticity
.large[
- If price of hazelnut creamer goes up, the demand for french vanilla creamer would increase.
`$$\frac{\% \text{ Change in Quantity Demanded for French Vanilla}}{\% \text{ Change in Price of Hazelnut Creamer}}$$`

- If price of Columbian coffee rises, demand for Peruvian coffee rises


`$$\frac{\% \text{ Change in Quantity Demanded for Peruvian Coffee}}{\% \text{ Change in Price of Columbian Coffee}}$$`
]
---

## Math Speak
.large[
For a good X and good Y that are substitutes, we can calculate the Cross-Price Elasticity as
`$$\frac{\% \text{ Change in Quantity Demanded for Good X}}{\% \text{ Change in Price of Good Y}}$$`

## In Review

.large[
Elasticity allows us to get at **to what extent** does a change in one variable impact another.
